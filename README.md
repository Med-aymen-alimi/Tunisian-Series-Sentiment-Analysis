# Tunisian Series Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
Tunisian television series attract a large audience, particularly during the month of Ramadan. In recent years, many viewers have expressed dissatisfaction, claiming that producers focus more on controversy and media buzz than on meaningful and high-quality content.

This project addresses this issue by applying sentiment analysis to YouTube comments related to Tunisian TV series. By analyzing public feedback, the project aims to extract valuable insights about audience opinions and help content creators better understand viewer expectations.

The solution combines traditional machine learning algorithms with deep learning techniques to perform Arabic sentiment classification.

## Dataset Description
- Source: YouTube comments related to Tunisian TV series
- Total samples: 9,318
- Features:
  - Text: Arabic user comments
  - Sentiment: Target label

### Sentiment Labels
- 1 : Positive  
- 0 : Neutral  
- -1 : Negative  

---

## Methodology

### Data Extraction
- Collected comments from selected YouTube videos related to Tunisian series
- Retained only the comment text column
- Removed emojis, numeric-only comments, repetitive words, and duplicates

### Data Annotation
- Manual labeling of comments into:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative

### Data Analysis
- Exploratory analysis of sentiment distribution
- Visualization using pie charts and bar charts

### Data Preprocessing
- Removal of non-Arabic characters
- Removal of HTML tags
- Normalization of whitespace
- Removal of single characters
- Removal of null and duplicate rows

## Feature Engineering

### TF-IDF Vectorization
TF-IDF was used to convert Arabic text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models by measuring the importance of words across documents.

### Word Embeddings
Pre-trained FastText Arabic word embeddings were used for the LSTM model. These embeddings represent words as dense vectors in a continuous space and were trained on large-scale Arabic text corpora.

## Models

### Machine Learning Models
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (Polynomial Kernel)
- Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel)
- SGD Classifier

### Deep Learning Model
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

---

## Evaluation

### LSTM Model Performance
- Best accuracy achieved: 0.51681
- Performance was below expectations

Identified challenges:
- Data semantic mismatch
- Sensitivity to hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of LSTM units
- Need for extensive hyperparameter tuning

### Machine Learning Models Performance
- More stable performance compared to the LSTM model
- Best-performing model saved for deployment

---

## Deployment
Two deployment scripts are provided:
- deployment_lstm.py: Deploys the trained LSTM model
- deployment_sigmoid.py: Deploys the machine learning sentiment classifier

Both scripts load the trained model and vectorizer to predict sentiment from new Arabic text inputs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- FastText
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be used to analyze audience feedback on Tunisian TV series. While the LSTM model faced performance limitations, traditional machine learning models delivered more consistent results. The insights generated by this system can help content creators better align their productions with audience expectations.
